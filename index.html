								Yo! I'm André Gonçalves, a 22 years old software designer/developer
								and a tech enthusiast. My first contact with software development was in 2017, when I started
								studying at the technical school IFC (a federal institute in my state).
							</p>
							<p class="more-content langchange">
								Back in these days, I made my first website for a homework, the class was just about HTML but I started 
								learning JS and CSS cause I wanted to do a beauty and functional website. My teacher gave me a 0 and told me
								to redo using HTML exactly the way he asked to. I think it was a important lesson: first to don't rush the 
								learning proccess and second to use tools that the project needs, don't overuse solutions that no contributes 
								to the final result. IFC formed me as a Web Developer (my actual occupation area), but I have infinity interest 
								areas besides it: cyber security, AI, automations, hardware... I'd love to explore all tech sides cause at first 
								look it feels like magic, you don't understand what's happening, but then you study about it, dive deep and 
								you reveal how the trick is done.

								While studying on IFC I learned the most basic tools for a complete web system development: 
								HTML, JS/jQuery, PHP and MySQL. Also had some introduction classes about some other languages 
								and frameworks like Angular, Nodejs and Bootstrap. On my first job (IPM Systems), 
								in a period of two years and a half, I was part of the team that developed a web system 
								for management of cities health centers using the same technologies I had learned, which 
								make me master HTML, JS/jQuery, PHP and MySQL. On my second job (NxFácil) I learned PostgreSQL, 
								which have a different syntax comparing to MySQL, and I develop two systems in parallel, an ERP 
								using native PHP on backend and Bootstrap with jQuery on frontend and a project management software 
								(like Trello), also uses the same front but with Laravel as backend. I developed a Whatsapp API 
								to use in these two softwares using NodeJS and a library called puppeteer, also did an API for 
								third party software consume and insert data in the ERP using Laravel and documented it with Postman. Also I'm responsible for controlling and maintaining the servers, gaving me skills with Linux, servers and AWS Management. The other skills I acquired through self-taught study.

								IPM was my first job, I started doing a free course that they're doing and they hired me 
								because of my good performance at this course. Used in practice the languages i've learned on IFC. 
								Desigred my role as "Fullstack" cause I did developed both front and backend. On NxFácil I also use 
								the previously learned technologies but also others that I don't had any contact and learned how to 
								use while I developed (technical details in the skills tab). Desigred my function as "Fullcycle" 
								cause different from fullstack, here I take care of the entire software cycle: requirements analysis 
								and gathering, developing front and backend and also deploying the system, because I'm responsible 
								for the servers too. This work gave me a big bag of knowledge (and responsibilities too).
